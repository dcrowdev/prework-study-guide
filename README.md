# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## A study guide Webpage built using what I've learned so far in the bootcamp prework materials

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- I want to be prepared as much as possible for bootcamp!
- To help me better understand and be able to study the fundamentals of programming!
- It allows me to have an easily accessible study guide I can reference!
- I learned a little about coding in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I also learned a lot about how to professionally     integrate my work using github and also the basics of Git!
